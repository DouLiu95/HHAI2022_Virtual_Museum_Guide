But the painting is dated 1661, when Rembrandt was living on Rozengracht, on the other side of Amsterdam. However, there is documentary evidence that he had already made a painting of two black men while living in Jodenbreestraat. Were there other paintings of this subject? Or did Rembrandt only finish off the first painting and date it a few years later? 
It is also unusual that Rembrandt depicted the close bond between the two men. Were they friends? Or perhaps brothers? It remains speculation, but if the models were brothers, and if they came from the neighbourhood, they may have been Bastiaan and Manuel Fernando. They were sailors from the island of São Tomé in their early twenties, who lived at the end of the street near Sint Antoniespoort.","77.8","http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Rembrandt%20Harmensz.%20van%20Rijn%20157.jpg","Two moors","1","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17276026","64.4",,,
