Lots of potential :) My main issues are: 
- It should be more flexible with input, e.g. it didn't accept ""portrait of a man"", but only ""Portrait of a Man"", which is easy to fix
- I gave up on text input, and instead only used buttons. For usability/ease of use all forms of input should have a purpose, so if text input isn't helpful in the first place, I'd leave it out completely! Alternatively, if text input works better, I can imagine that I'd prefer it to buttons.
- I felt a bit lost on how to start, so perhaps an example interaction with the agent before starting could be useful. E.g. how to ask about genre of the painting? I couldn't find out quickly, because asking it just resulted in ""what did you say?"" (or something similar)
- If the agent doesn't know what you mean, it could be good to give a suggestion on how to rephrase or what the problem could be. E.g.: I could not find a painting of that name, try using capitalization correctly! Or, ""Maybe you'd like to know something about painting x, perhaps -> genre -> related paintings""... this kind of thing! I think that would already be a great help.

Good luck, this is super cool!","",""
